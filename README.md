## Idle
Idle is a job search platform where recruiters and candidates come together in a single space. Built entirely with Laravel, Idle provides a secure and optimized environment for managing job opportunities, making it easier for companies to find top talent and for job seekers to discover their next career move.

Idle features a robust authentication system with seamless registration and login capabilities. To ensure user authenticity, a verification email is automatically sent upon registration. This step confirms the validity of the userâ€™s email address, safeguarding the platform and fostering a trustworthy ecosystem for both recruiters and candidates.
